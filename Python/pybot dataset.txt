-- What are Python decorators?
- A Python decorator is a specific change that we make in Python syntax to alter functions .
-- What is lambda in Python?
- It is a single expression anonymous function often used as inline function.
-- Explain how to delete a file in Python?
-  By using a command os.remove (filename) or os.unlink(filename) 
-- How Python is interpreted?
- Python language is an interpreted language. Python program runs directly from the source code. It converts the source code that is written by the programmer into an intermediate language, which is again translated into machine language that has to be executed.
-- What is the difference between list and tuple?
- The difference between list and tuple is that list is mutable while tuple is not. Tuple can be hashed for e.g as a key for dictionaries.
--  How are arguments passed by value or by reference?
-  Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. The references values are according to the functions; as a result you cannot change the value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable.
--  What is Dict and List comprehensions are?
- They are syntax constructions to ease the creation of a Dictionary or List based on existing iterable.
--  What is namespace in Python?
-  In Python, every name introduced has a place where it lives and can be hooked for. This is known as namespace. It is like a box where a variable name is mapped to the object placed. Whenever the variable is searched out, this box will be searched, to get corresponding object.
--  Why lambda forms in python does not have statements?
-  A lambda form in python does not have statements as it is used to make new function object and then return them at runtime.
--  What is pass in Python?
-  Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a place holder in compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.
--  What is pickling and unpickling?
-  Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.
--  What is map function in Python?
- map function executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as the second argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 arguments, then many iterables are given.
--  What is Python?
- Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
--  What are the supported data types in Python?

-  It will print complete string. Output would be Hello World!.
--  What are tuples in Python?
-  A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.
--  What are Python's dictionaries?
-  Pythons dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

--  When would you use a continue statement in a for loop?
-  When processing a particular item was complete; to move on to the next, without executing further processing in the block. The continue statement says, “I’m done processing this item, move on to the next item.”
-- When would you use a break statement in a for loop?
-  When the loop has served its purpose. As an example. after finding the item in a list searched for, there is no need to keep looping. The break statement says, I’m done in this loop; move on to the next block of code.”
